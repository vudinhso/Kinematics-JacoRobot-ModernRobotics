# Kinematics-JacoRobot-ModernRobotics
Use of screw theory instead of modified DH
For forward kinematics: 
- FK_4DOF_DH.m: calculate the FK for the Jaco Robot with 4-DOFs, 
                with the modified DH-parameters.
- FK_6DOF_curv_DH.m: 
                calculate the FK for the Jaco Robot with 6-DOFs, 
                with the curved wrist, 
                with the modified DH-parameters.
- FK_6DOF_sphr_DH.m: 
                calculate the FK for the Jaco Robot with 6-DOFs, 
                with the spherical wrist, 
                with the modified DH-parameters.
- fcn_Tmatrix.m: Build the transformation matrix SE(3) based on the DH-parameters
